# AML_project_submission
for this work, following packages need to be installed:
1) mlr3verse : aims at easily installong and loading the "mlr3" package family
   on Github : https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3verse
2) mlr3oml : an interface that connects R and OpenML.org and turns OpenMl objects automatically into mlr3 objects.
   for this work: used for extracting tasks
   on Github: https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3oml
3) mlr3mbo : provides both ready-to-go optimization algorithms as well as building blocks allowing for custom algorithms.
   for this work : used for Bayesian Optimization
   on Github : https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3mbo
4) DiceKriging : estimation, validation and prediction of kriging models.
   for this work : compute surrogate models for BO
   on Github : https://github.com/cran/DiceKriging
5) ranger: a fast implementation of random forest
   R Documentation : https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ranger/versions/0.14.1/topics/ranger
6) skimr : provides summary statistics for corresponding objects
   for this work: task data investigation
   on R-Project : https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/skimr/vignettes/skimr.html
